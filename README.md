# Messenger Handoff

Messenger Handoff is a planned self-hosted service for handling customer messages from Telegram and VK in one operator workspace.

## How it works

1. A customer opens a Telegram bot or writes to a VK community.
2. The service answers common questions or offers to contact an operator.
3. A request becomes a separate topic in a private Telegram group.
4. An operator replies in that topic.
5. The customer receives the reply in the original channel.

Operators work in Telegram, while customers do not need to switch between services.

## Technology

- TypeScript and Node.js
